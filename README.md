This course is aimed at studying the field of information security
There are several main files in each folder:
/backend - the folder where the back part of the application is located, all basic operations take place in it
/env - the virtual environment used in python
/public or /front - the frontend part written in React.js

1.1 is Caesar's cipher, but for some reason there is nothing there.. apparently the files are lost, but 1.2 contains the Caesar cipher, so you can use this file
1.2 - breaking the Caesar cipher
2.1 - the Vigener cipher
3 - breaking the Vigener cipher
4 - encryption based on gamification (block coupling)
5 - 
/gamm - hacking gamming
/rsa - implementation of the RSA algorithm
6 - hacking the rsa algorithm, the quadratic sieve method, hacks is good for a 60-bit public key N
7 - client-server application, implemented Diffie-Hellman algorithm, digital signature, SHA1, RC4 for sending a message


In order to run each file, it is necessary that all extensions are pre-installed: react.js , npm packages, preferably not lower than version 10.1, flask virtual environment for python


First, start the virtual environment using the following command "source /env/bin/activate" in the console, then go to the "front" or "public" folder and run "npm start". The local host will open in the browser and you will be able to use the application

Good luck, my dear friend!
